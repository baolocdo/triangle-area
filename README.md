Go to `triangle-area.js` and implement the function `getTriangleArea()`. You should only change the `result` with the correct formula.

Note that `base` and `height` are the function's parameters that will be given by the function caller so there are no concrete values for them. You need to think in abstraction instead of hard-coding any numbers in this function.
